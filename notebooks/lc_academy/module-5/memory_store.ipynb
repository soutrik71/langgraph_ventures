    "## Review\n",
    "\n",
    "[Memory](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10410470/) is a cognitive function that allows people to store, retrieve, and use information to understand their present and future. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are [various long-term memory types](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#memory) that can be used in AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll introduce the [LangGraph Memory Store](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/store/#langgraph.store.base.BaseStore) as a way to save and retrieve long-term memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build a chatbot that uses both `short-term (within-thread)` and `long-term (across-thread)` memory.\n",
    " \n",
    "We'll focus on long-term [semantic memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#semantic-memory), which will be facts about the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "These long-term memories will be used to create a personalized chatbot that can remember facts about the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will save memory [\"in the hot path\"](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#writing-memories), as the user is chatting with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "`short-term memory` has already been implemented in the chatbot, and we'll add `long-term memory` to it."
