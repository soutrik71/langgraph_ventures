The update also discusses the investment team's unchanged portfolio allocation and their focus on US technology stocks due to technological change.\", 'pk': '867c6724-e8fd-4692-858d-a2c2a225aa2c'}, page_content='significant announcements; the US and China.Starting with the US, the Federal Reserve - or simply \"the Fed\" - has been trying to contain inflation in the US economy since the start of 2022. The Fed has a few tools to do this, but interest rates are one of the most powerful. By increasing (or tightening) rates to their highest level since 2007, inflation has indeed come down a long way and is now close to where the Fed wants it. The downside of higher interest rates is that they can stifle economic growth.In September, the Fed was happy enough to cut rates for the first time in four years, and by 0.5%; a bigger move than its usual 0.25%. Investors saw it as good news, which was reflected by the market movements. Expectations are for the Fed to continue cutting rates steadily.It\\'s important to say that there are still elements of the US economy that the Fed will be watching carefully. Containing inflation and keeping it steady is a delicate task.Some contributors to the overall inflation figure – specifically wage inflation – remain higher than is ideal. Even so, this is partially offset by stable and growing productivity, so we think the steady pace of rate cuts will continue for now. In general, the economy overall looks to be in good shape.China is pulling out all the stopsThe Fed’s decision was well received by the market, but also not a huge surprise. The People\\'s Bank of China (PBoC), conversely, announced a series of surprisingly aggressive policy changes, in a bid to reverse the economy’s persistent slowdown.\\xa0 Chinese equities rallied sharply following the news.The measures included\\xa0interest rate and mortgage rate cuts, and financing assistance for the\\xa0ailing property market. Some restrictions on property purchases are also being removed. In addition, the Chinese government announced measures aimed at supporting the equity market. Time will tell if these various policy measures will improve economic performance enough to reach China\\'s growth targets. The Nutmeg investment team aren’t convinced, not yet anyway. To see sustained strength in domestic demand, we feel more is needed.What did the investment team do?The investment team didn\\'t change portfolio allocation over the month. Our positive outlook for economic growth means we have retained our bias towards equities. We also think that technological change is playing an important role in how economies and equities behave. And we are positioned for this trend by being over-allocated to US technology stocks.\\xa0Thanks for watching.

US stocks fell back, but European and Chinese equities made notable gains.At a glanceEuropean stocks rose, while US markets declined, led by weakness in growth-focused sectors.The US macroeconomic picture saw some negative signals, such as US consumer confidence hitting an eight-month low. However, we think the positive long-term picture remains intact.In Europe, there are some signs of changing sentiment, with indications of renewed confidence in the region’s prospects.What happened in financial markets in February?It’s been an interesting month in global financial markets. Investors had a lot of geopolitical news to digest, especially from the US, where the new Republican Administration was busy during its first month in office. Global stock markets saw some divergence in performance. Regions such as Europe and China have performed well, while others such as the US have seen a dip in stock market performance.In Europe, there are some signs of changing sentiment, with indications of renewed confidence in the region’s prospects. European stocks made gains, up 3.5% over the month, while there were notable\\xa0gains\\xa0in\\xa0German\\xa0and Italian equity indices, up 6.3% and 7.2%, respectively.
